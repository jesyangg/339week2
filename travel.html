            <h2>Yellowstone National Park</h2>
            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>

            <p>Yellowstone National Park is located in the northwest region of the United States, covering an area of 3,472 square miles. The park is primarily situated in the northwest corner of Wyoming, accounting for 96% of its total area. However, it also extends into Montana and Idaho, which make up 3% and 1% of the park respectively. The park has five entrances: north, northeast, east, south, and west, and includes eight developed visitor areas.</p> 
            <P> The park's vast expanse encompasses a variety of natural features, including lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake, one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America, is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The park is also home to the world's largest concentration of geysers and hydrothermal features. This diverse landscape makes Yellowstone National Park a significant ecological site, and in 1978, it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</P>
